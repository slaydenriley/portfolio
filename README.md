## Overview

Well, this is finally it. After a year and a half of hacking away at Flatiron‚Äôs online self-paced software engineering course, I‚Äôve finished my last project. The crux of the course. A ‚Äúmagnum opus.‚Äù The most frustrating, bug-ridden $%#$@#‚Ä¶.well, nevermind. I DID IT!

For my final project, I decided to build something that would help kickstart my career in web development. Using a Rails API backend and React + Redux on the frontend, I created my very own portfolio website to showcase my previous work at Flatiron, my blog posts, and my future work as a developer.

That‚Äôs right, my portfolio project is a portfolio. ü§Ø

## The Backend

On the backend, you'll find Ruby on Rails. This app requires Ruby 3.0.0 and Rails 6. To get this running locally:

* ```fork https://github.com/slaydenriley/portfolio & clone```
* ```cd portfolio/backend from your local directory```
* ```bundle install```
* ```rake db:migrate```
* ```rake db:seed```
* ```rails s```

## The Frontend

On the frontend, you'll find React + Redux.

* ```cd portfolio/frontend from your local directory```
* ```npm start```
* ```open browser to localhost:3000```
