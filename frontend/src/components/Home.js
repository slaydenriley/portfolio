        <p>
          Hello, my name is Riley Slayden! I am an (almost) graduate of
          Flatiron School's software engineering course. The technologies I use include
          Ruby on Rails, React/Redux. HTML/CSS/Javascript.</p>
        <p>
          Aside from coding, I am a huge outdoor enthusiast. Being raised in Montana, I was exposed
          to skiing, fly-fishing, hiking, camping, to mention a few.
